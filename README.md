# Javascript Game: Simon Says!

Though I already completed my capstone for Web Development, I was provided with two options to choose from. I had a lot of fun with Whack-a-Mole so I figured I'd give the other capstone option a shot just for practice. Before you is my version of Simon Says - an ancient summoning ritual game called Stones Speak. Original instructions for the assignment are located in `project-guide.md`.

## Version History

|Version|Description|
|------|------|
| Version 0.9 **(CURRENT)** | Separated `README.md` from `project-guide.md` and added a brief description, modified graphics on page (buttons, background), and moved unused assets into `assets/backup`. Fixed other minor issues including bug caused by losing on first color |
| Version 0.8 | Fixed issues with activatePads and resetGame. Game is fully functional and reflects original requirements now documented in `project-guide.md`.  |
| Version 0.7 | Followed directions in the original `README.md`, filled out `index.html`, `index.js`, and `styles.css` to have basic working game. Title was implemented but game not fully functional. |

## How to Play

To begin the game, simply click the "Begin" button. Upon click, the computer will randomly choose a colored stone. If you select the correct color you will proceed to the next round. Each round adds additional colors to memorize and repeat back.

## To Do:

I have some upcoming plans to make the game a bit nicer! In no particular order, later updates will come with:

- background music
- more animation for the stones
- more page animations in general
- difficulty options

Suggestions are welcome!
